                <p>For the first time in a while I have things to post again. Short of dumping new photos up here as I take them I haven't had much to really talk about. Today starts the SANS Holiday Hack challenge...</p>
                <a href="logposts/5.html"><h1>3-26-24</h1></a>
                <p>Following my trip to Arizona I was really frustrated with my phone's camera and my lack of ability to capture photos the way I wanted to. Because of this, I did the only natural thing and bought a new camera. The Canon EOS R100 is nothing special...</p>
                <a href="logposts/4.html"><h1>3-18-24</h1></a>
                <p>I've been offline for the past few days on vacation in Arizona. It's been nice to get some time away from home and tech and do some outdoors type stuff. I was able to visit Mexico for the first time, do lots of hiking...</p>

                <p>Took some time to be offline today and went for a nice walk/hike after work. The weather was beautiful and we're starting to get enough daylight to go out after work...</p>
                <a href="logposts/2.html"><h1>3-11-24</h1></a>
                <p>Today was primarily spent working on this site. I reformated the logs page to work better for showing multiple posts, added the projects list, and began populating the photos page with some of the old ones I had taken...</p>
                <a href="logposts/1.html"><h1>3-10-24</h1></a>
                <p>Today I dusted off an old project from about 4 years ago. One of my favorite game series of all time is Emily is Away and back when the third game came out I worked on a project to create a scriptable version of the game in HTML, CSS, and JS...</p>
