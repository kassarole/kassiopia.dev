                <p>A better day today I think. Still hard but not as soul crushing and no full breakdowns. I had my appointment today. Labs next week then I can go back on the pills. The provider was nice I hope she'll be with me going forward.</p>
                <p>K still doesn't seem to understand what they're doing. It's the little things that stick to me. They'll say they understand when I bring up why I'm hurt or bothered and then continue to do those things. I don't think it's conscious or delibrate but it hurts. I'll see them on Sunday and I pray that things feel normal. If they don't I don't know how much longer we can be in each other's lives.</p>
                <p>The bad thoughts still come at night but that's expected at this point. For once things were actually going well tho. I was out with friends, having a good time, only to be pulled back down again by work.</p>
                <p>I know things won't be like this forever</p>
                <p>This too shall pass.</p>
