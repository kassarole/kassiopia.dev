                <p>Today was rough. Lots of days lately are rough. I had bad dreams again. This time they were with someone from high school instead of college. It's not their fault and they've been so patient and kind with me.</p>
                <p>Next week I leave for Arizona and that'll be helpful but I can't help but think it's just a momentary distraction from the neverending pile of shit I'm in right now</p>
                <p>I'm trying to be better. Tomorrow I have my appointment and I've promised myself to get therapy when I get back from my trip.</p>
                <p>This too shall pass.</p>
