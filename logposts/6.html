                <p>For the first time in a while I have things to post again. Short of dumping new photos up here as I take them I haven't had much to really talk about. Today starts the SANS Holiday Hack challenge and I wrote some thoughts about it, as well as will be posting my solutions on my <a href="https://www.blog.kassiopia.dev">blog</a>. The short version is, try it out! see if you like it. This year is the most accessible it's ever been. Outside of that I have more short posts coming about some of the vintage computers I bought at VCF over the past few months and always more photos as I hike and travel.</p>
                <p>Stay safe. Remember you are loved <3</p>
