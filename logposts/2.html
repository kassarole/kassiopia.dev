                <p>Today was primarily spent working on this site. I reformated the logs page to work better for showing multiple posts, added the projects list, and began populating the photos page with some of the old ones I had taken. I think it'll be ready to go live soon but I'd like to add in a few more elements to make the space more my own. The About page could use some fleshing out and the main page could use a bit more information/90s & 2000s flair.</p>
                <p>This'll probably take a bit of a back burner tomorrow tho as I'd like to spend more time working on neversaygoodbye. With the friends list being dynamic, next is getting the wall, info, and photos tabs populating correctly. Once that is done we're back into the actual hard part of getting the scripting for actual game events working again. The idea is something RenPy like and the core engine for doing that is there it's just a matter of getting all the prices working together. Hopefully I'll have something to show off with this soon so stay tuned.</p>
