                <p>I've been offline for the past few days on vacation in Arizona. It's been nice to get some time away from home and tech and do some outdoors type stuff. I was able to visit Mexico for the first time, do lots of hiking, see a ghost town as well as see a road runner. As usual I'll have the photos page updated soon with the ones I've taken while here</p>
                <p>When I get home tomorrow I have some new project ideas I plan to get into as well as some larger blog posts I'd like to finish up and post so I hope to have more to say about those soon. Not to mention I still have more work to do on neversaygoodbye, this site and any number of my current active projects.</p>
