                <p>Following my trip to Arizona I was really frustrated with my phone's camera and my lack of ability to capture photos the way I wanted to. Because of this, I did the only natural thing and bought a new camera. The Canon EOS R100 is nothing special but I've been happy with the reults I've been getting. I've uploaded a few new photos to the photos page.</p>
                <p>On the project front I'm closing in on having a demo version of neversaygoodbye ready to show off. It won't be much more than a static site at this point but I think it's worth showing off.</p>
