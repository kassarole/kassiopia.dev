                <p>Today I dusted off an old project from about 4 years ago. One of my favorite game series of all time is Emily is Away and back when the third game came out I worked on a project to create a scriptable version of the game in HTML, CSS, and JS so that anyone could write their own stories in the style. This was a peak COVID project and the other person I was working with it on was in the process of preparing for a graduate program so work quickly faded but my interest in the idea didn't. Working on this site gave me new motivation to resume learning JS and, through that, continue working on the project. I hope to have things to show off soon but for now it's just a lot of cleanup and making new mistakes.</p>
                <p>I also plan to put some time this week into fixing some of the last issues with my DiscordMonitor program so I can write the blog post for that and publish it. Hopefully more news coming soon. Stay tuned.</p>
