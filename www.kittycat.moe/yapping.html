        <h3>Yappings</h3>
        <p>Planning to use this as a space for random thoughts that don't necessarily need a full blog post. Think brief updates on things I'm testing/working on.</p>

            <p>Trying out a crossposting thing for my little blog areas here and on my other site. I've been hard at work moving stuff from my old docker servers over to kubernetes. I went with 3 optiplex 7050m's since they were a good price on ebay. Somewhat interestingly these machines have vPro chips so I've also had a chance to play with Intel AMT. I should be able to get all my proxy hosts cut over today and then I'll be almost completely on the new cluster. I'm leaving some containers on docker becuase they're more trouble than they're worth but I'll be downsizing from five docker servers to only one or two.</p>
            <p>I also had the chance to get away for the long weekend last weekend and went up to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for the first time. I got some new photos and those have been added. I'm hoping to get some more travel booked soon to be able to get some nice fall shots before settling into winter.</p>

            <p>Pushing this site live. I'm excited to have somewhere a bit simpler than my other site. I still plan to keep kassiopia.dev running and making periodic updates there but this site feels more in the spirit of my initial goals for making a personal site.</p>
            <p>For projects, I've gotten my nixos config to a place I'm happy with. I've been using hyprland for a few weeks now and I'm really enjoying it. I also should be getting some new PCBs soon so if everything goes well I should eb able to launch that project. More good things to come soon I hope so stay checked in.</p>
