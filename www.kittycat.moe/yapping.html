        <h3>Yappings</h3>
        <p>Planning to use this as a space for random thoughts that don't necessarily need a full blog post. Think brief updates on things I'm testing/working on.</p>

            <p>Pushing this site live. I'm excited to have somewhere a bit simpler than my other site. I still plan to keep kassiopia.dev running and making periodic updates there but this site feels more in the spirit of my initial goals for making a personal site.</p>
            <p>For projects, I've gotten my nixos config to a place I'm happy with. I've been using hyprland for a few weeks now and I'm really enjoying it. I also should be getting some new PCBs soon so if everything goes well I should eb able to launch that project. More good things to come soon I hope so stay checked in.</p>
