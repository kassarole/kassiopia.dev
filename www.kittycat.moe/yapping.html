            <p>Got to finally travel again and spent a week in Washington. It was one of the most beautiful places I think I've ever visited. I also decided it's finally time to upgrade my camera gear. I'm moving away from the R100 and I've started to use an R10. I haven't had the chance to take it out and really put it through its paces but the performance in the test shots I've done has been really impressive. Next week I'll be traveling to New Orleans and, while city photography isn't my usual vibe, I'm hoping to get some new stuff</p>
            <p>On more technical projects, my partner and I have been making progress on an Android focussed project that I'll hopefully have news on soon. I've also recently started the process of reorganizing and reworking my Nixos configs so that they can be publically posted and shared online. It'll probably be a while before I get things in a state that I think they're ready to go live but I'm working on it.</p>

            <p>This past weekend was VCF Midwest. This year was my first time at the event and I had a great time. I used this as an opportunity to pick up some new Meshtastic nodes. For those unaware, Meshtastic is a LoRA based mesh network using 915 MHz. There's a pretty solid mesh in the Chicago area I've had limited interaction with in the past but the new nodes I picked up should greatly increase my range. I've also bridged myself to the main network via MQTT. so I'm hoping to increase my interaction inside the community</p>
            <p>Over the next few weeks and months I'll be traveling more and should be able to get some more photos. I've also licensed and uploaded all my current photos to flickr <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/fauxkassarole/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Trying out a crossposting thing for my little blog areas here and on my other site. I've been hard at work moving stuff from my old docker servers over to kubernetes. I went with 3 optiplex 7050m's since they were a good price on ebay. Somewhat interestingly these machines have vPro chips so I've also had a chance to play with Intel AMT. I should be able to get all my proxy hosts cut over today and then I'll be almost completely on the new cluster. I'm leaving some containers on docker becuase they're more trouble than they're worth but I'll be downsizing from five docker servers to only one or two.</p>
            <p>I also had the chance to get away for the long weekend last weekend and went up to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for the first time. I got some new photos and those have been added. I'm hoping to get some more travel booked soon to be able to get some nice fall shots before settling into winter.</p>

            <p>Pushing this site live. I'm excited to have somewhere a bit simpler than my other site. I still plan to keep kassiopia.dev running and making periodic updates there but this site feels more in the spirit of my initial goals for making a personal site.</p>
            <p>For projects, I've gotten my nixos config to a place I'm happy with. I've been using hyprland for a few weeks now and I'm really enjoying it. I also should be getting some new PCBs soon so if everything goes well I should eb able to launch that project. More good things to come soon I hope so stay checked in.</p>
