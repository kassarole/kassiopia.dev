                <p>Missed a day of writing this but that's mostly because things have been going better. L was free to hang out tonight and had been sick last week. That's why they hadn't been around. It was good to be around people again. I have plans tomorrow too I got invited to play a TTRPG with my friends online. This site also inspired me to dust off an old project from almost 4 years ago so there may be more coming with that soon.</p>
                <p>Because I fucked up my fasting on friday I did a full fast yesterday. It was was easier than I thought it would be but I have to be careful. I don't want Ana in my life anymore. That's not the way forward.</p>
                <p>Spending time with K was pretty all over the place. In some moments everything was perfect and in others it felt like they wanted to be anywhere else. I need to be away for a bit I think. I want them to want to be with me and it just doesn't feel like that's what they want. I left the day feeling used.</p>
                <p>I leave for AZ this week so I'll actually have some photos to upload here soon. Even though things are rough I feel a corner may be aproaching. I'm still pushing through and still working.</p>
                <p>This too shall pass.</p>
